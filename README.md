# kanban-board

Following the (somewhat aged) Vue.js tutorial found on auth0.com to build a kanban board.
Found here: [https://auth0.com/blog/vuejs-kanban-board-the-development-process/](https://auth0.com/blog/vuejs-kanban-board-the-development-process/)

For simplicity, I used ```vue create kanban-board``` to begin the project, but tried to stick to all other points outlined in the tutorial
